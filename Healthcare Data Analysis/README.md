# 🩺 Healthcare Data Analysis

This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **statistical insights** on a healthcare dataset to identify trends, distributions, and relationships among various medical and demographic variables.  
The notebook demonstrates **data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis** — key skills for a **Data Analyst** or **Healthcare Analytics** role.

## 📊 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:
- Perform **data exploration** and **preprocessing**
- Analyze **key healthcare metrics** such as patient demographics, diagnoses, treatment costs, and hospital stay durations
- Visualize patterns and correlations using Python libraries
- Generate **statistical summaries** and actionable **data-driven insights**

📈 Insights Summary
Here are some of the key findings and observations from the analysis:

🧓 Age Group Trends: Middle-aged and senior patients (40–60+) accounted for the majority of hospital visits and medical expenses.

🏥 Length of Stay: Patients with chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) tended to have a longer average stay.

💰 Cost Drivers: Treatment costs showed strong correlation with both procedure type and length of stay, highlighting opportunities for cost optimization.

⚕️ Disease Distribution: Cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were the most frequent diagnoses, suggesting the need for focused preventive programs.

👩‍⚕️ Gender-Based Insights: Females showed higher admission rates for certain preventive and obstetric procedures, while males dominated chronic condition treatments.

📅 Seasonality: A slight spike in respiratory-related admissions was observed during winter months.

🧩 Future Enhancements
Integrate predictive modeling (e.g., hospital readmission prediction)

Include interactive dashboards using Power BI or Streamlit

Add SQL-based exploratory queries for deeper relational insights
