# 💰 Personal Loan Modeling & EDA

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and building a **predictive model** for personal loan approval.  
It demonstrates data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning modeling techniques — all essential skills for a **Data Analyst** or **Data Scientist**.

## 📊 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:
- Perform **EDA** on customer demographic and financial data  
- Identify key factors influencing **loan approval**  
- Build a **predictive model** using machine learning algorithms  
- Evaluate model accuracy and interpret feature importance

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** – data manipulation  
- **numpy** – numerical computation  
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn** – visualization  
- **scikit-learn** – machine learning and evaluation

📈 Key Insights Summary
💵 Income & Loan Approval: High-income customers showed a significantly higher approval rate.

🏦 Credit Card Holders: Existing credit card users were more likely to be approved for loans.

🧓 Age Influence: Middle-aged individuals (30–45) formed the bulk of approved loans.

🧾 Model Performance: Logistic Regression achieved ~85% accuracy, making it a reliable baseline model.

📊 Feature Importance: Key drivers included income, education, and credit card usage.

🧩 Future Enhancements
Add advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Integrate feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning

Deploy interactive dashboards in Power BI or Streamlit
